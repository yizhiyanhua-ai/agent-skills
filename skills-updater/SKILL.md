# Skills Updater

Manage, update, and discover Claude Code skills across multiple installation sources.

## Supported Sources

**Claude Code Plugins** (`~/.claude/plugins/`):
- `installed_plugins.json` - Tracks installed skills with versions
- `known_marketplaces.json` - Registered marketplace sources
- `cache/` - Installed skill files

**npx skills** (`~/.skills/` if present):
- Skills installed via `npx skills add <owner/repo>`
- Managed by skills.sh infrastructure

## Update Check Workflow

### Step 1: Scan Installed Skills

```bash
python scripts/check_updates.py
```

Output format:
```
📦 Installed Skills Status

   • skill-creator@daymade-skills (1.2.2)
   • github-ops@daymade-skills (1.0.0)
   ...

⬆️ Updates Available (3):
   • planning-with-files@planning-with-files
     Local: 2.5.0 → Remote: 2.6.1
   • superpowers@superpowers-marketplace
     Local: 4.0.3 → Remote: 4.1.0
   ...

⚠️ Unknown Version (2):
   • document-skills@anthropic-agent-skills (unknown)

```

### Step 2: Confirm Update Strategy

Present options to user:
1. **Update All** - Update all skills with available updates
2. **Select Individual** - Let user choose specific skills to update
3. **Skip** - Cancel the update process

### Step 3: Handle Local Modifications

Before updating, check for local modifications:

```bash
# Check if local skill has uncommitted changes
cd ~/.claude/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/<skill>/<version>
git status --porcelain
```

**If local changes detected:**
1. Create backup of modified files
2. Pull remote updates
3. Attempt 3-way merge
4. If conflicts:
   - Show conflict files to user
   - Offer manual resolution or keep local version

### Step 4: Execute Update

For Claude Code plugins:
```bash
# Trigger marketplace refresh and skill reinstall
# This uses Claude Code's built-in update mechanism
claude /install <skill-name>@<marketplace>
```

For npx skills:
```bash
npx skills add <owner/repo> --force
```

## Skill Recommendations

### Fetch Trending Skills

```bash
python scripts/recommend_skills.py --source all
```

### Install Recommended Skill

After showing recommendations, offer to install:

```
Would you like to install any of these skills?
1. Install by number (e.g., "1" or "1,3,5")
2. Install by name
3. Skip
```

## Version Detection Methods

### Primary: marketplace.json

Read version from remote marketplace.json:
```bash
curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/main/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json" | jq '.plugins[] | select(.name == "<skill>") | .version'
```

### Fallback: GitHub API

If marketplace.json unavailable or version not specified:
```bash
# Get latest release tag
curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/<owner>/<repo>/releases/latest" | jq -r '.tag_name'

# Or latest commit on main
curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/<owner>/<repo>/commits/main" | jq -r '.sha[:7]'
```

### Commit SHA Comparison

For skills tracking by commit (e.g., `e30768372b41`):
```bash
# Compare local gitCommitSha with remote HEAD
local_sha=$(jq -r '.plugins["<key>"][0].gitCommitSha' ~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json)
remote_sha=$(curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/<owner>/<repo>/commits/main" | jq -r '.sha')

if [ "$local_sha" != "$remote_sha" ]; then
  echo "Update available"
fi
```

## Smart Merge Strategy

When local modifications exist:

1. **Identify modified files**:
   ```bash
   git diff --name-only HEAD
   ```

2. **Categorize changes**:
   - SKILL.md customizations → Preserve user sections
   - scripts/ modifications → Keep local, note for review
   - references/ additions → Merge both
   - assets/ → Keep both versions if different

3. **Merge approach**:
   ```python
   # Pseudo-code for smart merge
   for file in modified_files:
       if file == 'SKILL.md':
           merge_skill_md(local, remote)  # Preserve user customizations
       elif file.startswith('scripts/'):
           backup_and_warn(local)  # User scripts need review
       else:
           three_way_merge(base, local, remote)
   ```

## User Interaction Patterns

### Check for Updates

User says: "检查 skills 更新" / "check skill updates" / "update my skills"

→ Run `scripts/check_updates.py` and display results

### Update Specific Skill

User says: "更新 skill-creator" / "update skill-creator"

→ Check and update only the specified skill

### Discover New Skills

User says: "推荐一些好用的 skills" / "recommend skills" / "popular skills"

→ Run `scripts/recommend_skills.py` and show curated list

### Full Update Workflow

User says: "更新所有 skills" / "update all skills"

→ Scan → Confirm → Handle merges → Update → Report results

## Error Handling

**Network errors**: Retry with exponential backoff, cache last known state

**Permission errors**: Suggest running with appropriate permissions

**Merge conflicts**: Show conflict markers, offer resolution options:
- Accept local (keep your changes)
- Accept remote (use upstream)
- Manual merge (show diff)

**Missing marketplace**: Inform user if source is no longer available
